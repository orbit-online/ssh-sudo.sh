# ssh-sudo

Bash library for executing remote sudo commands while preserving the tty.

## Installation

With [Î¼pkg](https://github.com/orbit-online/upkg)

```
upkg install -g orbit-online/ssh-sudo.sh@<VERSION>
```

## How it works

`ssh_sudo` works by creating two temporary files on the remote.
One (call it "askpass") as `$SSH_USER` which echoes the sudo password
(only readable and executable by `$SSH_USER`) and another that contains the
arguments to `ssh_sudo` (call it "script").
It then executes "script" with `SUDO_ASKPASS=askpassPath sudo -A scriptPath`.  
The two files are deleted after the script has completed.

## Functions

### `ssh_sudo [CMD...|SCRIPT]`

Run a command as root on the remote while preserving stdin, stdout,
and stderr.

### `ssh_cmd CMD...`

Run a command as `$SSH_USER` on the remote.

### `ssh_sudo_cmd CMD...`

Run a command as root on the remote but do not preserve stdin
(quicker).

## Environment variables

These variables do not need to be exported, you can define them in your script
as global variables and then use the above functions.

### `$SSH_USER`

Remote SSH user _required_

### `$SSH_HOST`

Remote SSH host _required_

### `$SSH_SUDO_PASS`

Remote SSH sudo password for `$SSH_USER` _required_

### `$SSH_OPTS`

Options to pass to all ssh invocations _optional_
